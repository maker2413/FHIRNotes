#+TITLE: The HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard

Now that we've wrapped up Part I, you should have a solid understanding of the
long journey the HL7 community took to arrive at the idea of modernizing
healthcare data exchange. We're now ready to dive into the core of this course -
the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, standard.

To begin with let's go over what HL7 FHIR originally meant. Due to the fact that
HL7v2 had become outdated and HL7v3 had grown too complex to gain widespread
adoption, HL7 International - a nonprofit organization that develop healthcare
data standards - introduced a new specification called Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources, or FHIR.

FHIR is a modern, flexible approach to sharing healthcare data, built on widely
used web technologies such as JSON and RESTful APIs. It enables seamless access
to and integration of healthcare information across different systems and
applications. As a result, FHIR has been increasingly adopted by healthcare
organizations and technology vendors around the world.

Now, let's take a look back at how FHIR came to be. First, let's dive into the
concept of Resources for Health. Back in the early 2010s, the people developing
healthcare data standards were feeling the pressure to modernize. The Health IT
community was eager to move beyond the legacy HL7 version 2 standard and adopt
technologies that supported cloud computing, mobile applications, and modern web
integration. At the same time, broader tech innovations were influencing
expectations - take Facebook, for example. Developers could build apps that
seamlessly integrated with Facebook's platform using a simple, JSON-based API.

Inspired by these trends, a new initiative called Resources for Health, or RFH,
emerged around 2010 to explore a modern, web-friendly approach to healthcare
interoperability. Resources for Health was the brainchild of Grahame Grieve,
Ewout Kramer, and Lloyd McKenzie. Their goal was to explore what a modern HL7
specification might look like if they started from scratch - focusing on web
technologies and RESTful design principles. They introduced the concept of a
"resource", which refers to a small, self-contained piece of medical
information.

Let's briefly dive into how FHIR's modeling approach differs from earlier HL7
standards. Unlike HL7 version 2, which organizes information into reusable
message segments tailored for specific workflows, FHIR introduces a set of
modular healthcare "resources". These resources are designed to represent common
clinical and administrative concepts, and can be combined in flexible ways to
meet a wide range of use cases.

This resource-based approach gives a lot of flexibility and makes it easier for
different systems to communicate effectively. Take a look at this table for a
high-level comparison of these modeling approaches:
| HL7v2                | FHIR                         |
|----------------------+------------------------------|
| Segments             | Resource Types               |
| Model by combination | Model by composition         |
| Trigger event based  | REST, subscription, Document |
| Extensible           | Extensible                   |
| MLLP                 | RESTful API                  |
| ER7                  | JSON, XML, RDF               |

Respectively, unlike HL7 version 3, which followed a "model by constraint"
methodology, FHIR takes a compositional approach. In FHIR, use cases are
typically addressed by linking multiple resources together through
references. While a single resource might be sufficient for a simple scenario,
more commonly, resources are combined and tailored to meet specific clinical or
business requirements.

* What is FHIR really about?
  Well, at its core, FHIR is a set of specifications that define how healthcare
  applications exchange information.

  It outlines what data is shared, how it's shared, and how it should be
  managed. FHIR supports multiple approaches - known as exchange paradigms - for
  sharing data between systems, with a strong emphasis on using modern web
  technologies like RESTful APIs. One of the great strengths of FHIR is that
  it's designed to be implementer-friendly - simple to understand and
  straightforward to use. The entire FHIR specification is freely available
  online, making it highly accessible. That's a big contrast compared to
  standards like X12, which can be harder to obtain and work with.

  After more than a decade of discussion and development, the FHIR standard has
  come a long way. What began as a simple one-page website with fewer than 50
  sections and just 9 established, plus 22 proposed, resource types has grown
  into a comprehensive platform with nearly 3500 pages and around 140
  well-defined resources.

* FHIR Specification
  To reference documentation on the FHIR specification simply review
  [[fhir.org]]. When reviewing documentation on the FHIR specification note that any
  page marked as ~N~ stands for "Normative", which simply means that that
  section is considered stable and is unlikely to change. Any page marked ~TU~
  stands for "Trial Use", which indicates that the item is still under review.

* FHIR Resources
  If you've explored different FHIR resource types, you've probably noticed they
  share a common structure. This typically includes a unique identifier,
  metadata stored by the system, and other elements. FHIR actually uses an
  inheritance model - somewhat similar to what we discussed earlier with HL7
  version 3 and the RIM.
